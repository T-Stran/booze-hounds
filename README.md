# BoozeHounds

Love pubs? Love dogs? Then you're in the right place. 

BoozeHounds allows users to find good, dog-friendly pubs in their neighbourhood, as well as filter these pubs by certain criteria and interact with their local community.

## Visit [BoozeHounds](www.boozehounds.dog) and have a sniff around!

### Motivation
The motivation for BoozeHounds came whilst trying to find out accurate information about which pubs were suitable for a dog on a friday night. Realising that to find out, you would have to contact pubs directly, my team and I decided to create BoozeHounds.

### Build
BoozeHounds was built using Ruby 3.1.2p20 and Rails 7.0.4.3 by [Tom Stranack](https://github.com/T-Stran), [James Corfe](https://github.com/jdc338), [Jerome Junkeer](https://github.com/JJunkeer), [Oliver Chesney](https://github.com/Oliver-Chesney) and [Daniel Ferree](https://github.com/dferree).

### Guide

2. From the pub show page, use the filter bar at the top to search for certain criteria
3. Select the pub you wish to learn more about.
4. From here, you can read and add reviews; see the locals and add your own dog as a local; join the pub's chatroom to speak to members of the community. (You'll need to login to add reviews, locals and use the chat function).
